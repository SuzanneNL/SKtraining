## INTRODUCTION
This is a website for a Dutch language teacher with a business called SK Training, Dutch language courses. The goal of this website is threefold: 
1. to attract new students;
2. to attract employers and get new assignments;
3. to give current students access to an online platform. 

To make sure a user doesn't lose interest by having to navigate through excessive information, the website has been designed in such a way, that a user will only see information that is relevant for him. To achieve this, the user will have to make a choice when first accessing the website. There are three options: 
1. 'I want to learn Dutch' gives access to part of the website that is meant to inform and attract potential new students for private or group lessons. 
2. 'I'm an employer' gives access to an overview of SK's resume to potential employers. 
3. 'I'm a student' is for current students. They have to login to get access to a shielded part of the website, where they can find and hand in homework, share pictures, ask questions - similar to Blackboard. This last part has not been developed (yet). 
This website can be viewed on desktop computer size monitors, tablets and mobile devices. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be viewed here.

## UX
### Goals
The goal of this website is threefold: 
1. to attract new students;
2. to attract employers and get new assignments;
3. to give current students access to an online platform. Having this platform makes sharing files and communicating with students more efficient and organized. 

### Target audiences
- Adults interested in learning Dutch;
- Dutch language schools looking for new teachers;
- Businesses that need a teacher to teach their employees work specific Dutch (in-company training);
- Current students that want to access the shielded online platform for announcements, homework, exercises, pictures.

### Business goals
- Attract new customers;
- Have a fully functional website with an intuitive design.

### Customer goals
- Find a trustworthy, experienced and skilled teacher for learning Dutch;
- Find information about the details of the courses that are offered and their fees;
- Easily get in touch with the company/teacher.

### User stories
As explained in the introduction, a user will have to make a decision which part of the website he would like to visit. By making this choice, the user will be presented information that is solely interesting for him. Many websites for Dutch language courses do not make this distinction, making it harder for a user to find the information that is relevant for him. 

As SK Training...
- I want my website to be attractive so that a user is enticed to explore it;
- I want my website to have a clear and simple structure, so that it is easy to navigate;
- I want my users to find the information they're looking for within a few clicks, so that they don't lose interest;
- I want my users to solely see information that is relevant for them, so that they don't lose interest or feel confused or bored because of the excessive information;
- I want my users to easily find the contact form to contact SK Training and ask for more information or arrange a first meeting; 
- I want my website to create the feeling that SK Training is a trustworthy company and that SK is a trustworthy teacher so that a potential student or employer will want to hire SK Training. 
 
As a UX designer...
- I want to see, by tracking user behavior, if the user can easily navigate the website and find information that's relevant for him. 
- I want to see which parts of the website are visited most, so I know they are easily accessible and use this to further structure my website. 
- I want to see which parts of the website are visited least, to improve navigation to or remove these parts.

As a potential new student...
- I want to be able to understand the information on this website. 
(Many websites offering Dutch language courses are actually in Dutch, making it difficult for foreigners to understand the information. And foreigners are the targeted audience of this website! Therefore, the website is in English. Expanding the project could be done by presenting the information in multiple languages. But unless they are (near- )native English speakers, too much information can be confusing. Also, a large group of language learners is 'digitally illiterate'. Use of a simple website structure, pictures, icons and bullet points will guide a user to the right parts of the website and provide the information that is relevant.)
- I want to know who my teacher would be and why she can be trusted. 
(Pictures of the teacher and happy students combined with a short "about me" explaining that I'm a certified Dutch language teacher, create confidence that the teacher is friendly and qualified to teach Dutch, and that students are content.)
- I want to know when and where classes are given, so that this will fit into my personal schedule.
- I want to know how much the courses cost, so that I can decide if this fits in my budget. 
- I want to be able to easily contact the teacher so that I can ask for more information or request a first meeting. 

As a potential new employer (either a recruiter from a Dutch language school or a business looking for an in- company training to educate their employees)...
- I want to know if the teacher is trustworthy so that I know if I can hire her;
- I want to know if the teacher is certified by the BVNT2 so that I know if I can hire her;
- I want to see if the teacher has relevant work experience so that I know if I can hire her;

As a current student
- I want to use the login field to get access to the shielded part of the website and not be distracted by irrelevant information. 

### Design
Three main colors are used throughout, matching with the image:

- ![#ef733e](https://placehold.it/15/ef733e/000000?text=+) #ef733e orange 'jaffa' (I deliberately chose orange because it's the Dutch national color)
- ![#777777](https://placehold.it/15/777777/000000?text=+) #777777 grey 'boulder'
